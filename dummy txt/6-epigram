The farmers entrust their seed to the fat earth,<br />
After having foliated it with their mattocks.<br />
The philosophers have taught that gold must be scattered over white fields<br />
Which react like a light leaf.<br />
When you undertake this, pay good attention to it,<br />
For from the wheat you see, as in a mirror, that gold germinates.
