                        The Philosophers have in many places made mention of four sorts of fire<span class="milestone">e03-01</span> 
                        necessary to the <span class="choice"><span class="orig">naturall </span><span class="reg">natural</span></span> <span class="choice"><span class="orig">worke </span><span class="reg">work</span></span>, namely Lully, the Author of Scala, Ripley,
                        and many others: and to this end Raymund speaking of fires (<span class="choice"><span class="orig">Sayth </span><span class="reg">Says</span></span> Scala).
                        You must note, that here are contrary operations: because as the fire 
                        against nature dissolves the Spirit of a fixed body into the water of a 
                        cloud, and binds the body of a volatile spirit into a congealed earth, <span class="choice"><span class="orig">soe </span><span class="reg">so</span></span>
                        <span class="choice"><span class="orig">contrarywise </span><span class="reg">contrariwise</span></span> the fire of nature <span class="choice"><span class="orig">congeales </span><span class="reg">congeals</span></span> the dissolved spirit of a fixed
                        body into a globous earth, and resolves the fixed body of a volatile 
                        Spirit by fire against nature, not into the water of a cloud, but into <span class="choice"><span class="orig">Philosophicall </span><span class="reg">Philosophical</span></span> water. Ripley speaks more clearly of these fires in gate 3. thus:
                        There are four sorts of fires, which you ought to know, the <span class="choice"><span class="orig">naturall </span><span class="reg">natural</span></span>, <span class="choice"><span class="orig">unnaturall </span><span class="reg">unnatural</span></span>, fire against nature, and <span class="choice"><span class="orig">elementall </span><span class="reg">elemental</span></span>, which <span class="choice"><span class="orig">kindleth </span><span class="reg">kindles</span></span> wood: These
                        fires <span class="choice"><span class="orig">wee </span><span class="reg">we</span></span> use, and <span class="choice"><span class="orig">noe </span><span class="reg">no</span></span> more. Fire against nature ought to excruciate 
                        <span class="choice"><span class="orig">bodyes </span><span class="reg">bodies</span></span>, that is the dragon, as I tell you, violently burning, as the fire of hell.
                        The fire of nature is the third menstruum, that fire is naturally in every
                        thing: Occasioned fire <span class="choice"><span class="orig">wee </span><span class="reg">we</span></span> call <span class="choice"><span class="orig">unnaturall </span><span class="reg">unnatural</span></span>, as the heat of ashes and baths
                        to putrefy: Without these fires you can bring nothing to putrefaction, whereby your matter may be separated, that it may at once be proportioned 
                        for a new conjunction: Make therefore a fire within in your <span class="choice"><span class="orig">glasse </span><span class="reg">glass</span></span>, which
                        can <span class="choice"><span class="orig">burne </span><span class="reg">burn</span></span> <span class="choice"><span class="orig">bodyes </span><span class="reg">bodies</span></span> more effectually, than <span class="choice"><span class="orig">elementall </span><span class="reg">elemental</span></span> fire: these are their
                        sayings. They are indeed called fires, because they have a fiery virtue, 
                        the <span class="choice"><span class="orig">naturall </span><span class="reg">natural</span></span> in coagulating, the <span class="choice"><span class="orig">unnaturall </span><span class="reg">unnatural</span></span> in dissolving, the fire against
                        nature in corrupting, the <span class="choice"><span class="orig">elementall </span><span class="reg">elemental</span></span> in <span class="choice"><span class="orig">administring </span><span class="reg">administering</span></span> the first heat and
                        motion: And there is a concatenated order observed in them, that the Second may be incited by the first, the third by the second, the fourth by
                        the third and first together to action, <span class="choice"><span class="orig">soe </span><span class="reg">so</span></span> as that one is the agent, and
                        the other the patient, and the same both agent and patient in different
                        respect: That which is observed in iron rings or pillars held together by a
                        Magnet, and <span class="choice"><span class="orig">joyned </span><span class="reg">joined</span></span> by <span class="choice"><span class="orig">mutuall </span><span class="reg">mutual</span></span> contact, the same in these fires: for the

                        and third even to the fourth, and <span class="choice"><span class="orig">joynes </span><span class="reg">joins</span></span> one to another by <span class="choice"><span class="orig">mutuall </span><span class="reg">mutual</span></span> 
                        operations, and <span class="choice"><span class="orig">causeth </span><span class="reg">causes</span></span> them to <span class="choice"><span class="orig">sticke </span><span class="reg">stick</span></span> together, till <span class="choice"><span class="orig">internall </span><span class="reg">internal</span></span> action be
                        effected amongst the uppermost: The first is <span class="choice"><span class="orig">elementall </span><span class="reg">elemental</span></span> fire indeed 
                        and name, the second is <span class="choice"><span class="orig">aire </span><span class="reg">air</span></span> or airy, the third <span class="choice"><span class="orig">watry </span><span class="reg">watery</span></span> or of a Lunar nature, the fourth earthy: It is <span class="choice"><span class="orig">needlesse </span><span class="reg">needless</span></span> to say any thing of the first, 
                        because it is <span class="choice"><span class="orig">knowne </span><span class="reg">known</span></span> to every mans eye and touch: The three other are
                        dragons, menstrua's, waters, Sulphurs, and <span class="choice"><span class="orig">Mercuryes </span><span class="reg">Mercuries</span></span>: Dragons, because 
                        being participants of venenosity, they <span class="choice"><span class="orig">devoure </span><span class="reg">devour</span></span> serpents of their <span class="choice"><span class="orig">owne </span><span class="reg">own</span></span>

                        and mixed with them: They are called Menstrua's, because the <span class="choice"><span class="orig">Philosophicall </span><span class="reg">Philosophical</span></span> infant is produced from them, and nourished therewith even to
                        its nativity: Lully in his <span class="choice"><span class="orig">booke </span><span class="reg">book</span></span> of the Quintessence, dist. 3. <span class="choice"><span class="orig">hath </span><span class="reg">has</span></span> two 
                        
                        
                        
                        <span class="pb">58</span>
                        Menstruums, the vegetable, and <span class="choice"><span class="orig">minerall </span><span class="reg">mineral</span></span>, Ripley in his <span class="choice"><span class="orig">Præface </span><span class="reg">Preface</span></span> of the gates <span class="choice"><span class="orig">hath </span><span class="reg">has</span></span>
                        three, which are really one and <span class="choice"><span class="orig">doe </span><span class="reg">do</span></span> agree: for the generation of the infant
                        is made of them <span class="choice"><span class="orig">alltogether </span><span class="reg">altogether</span></span>, and a white water <span class="choice"><span class="orig">præceeds </span><span class="reg">preceeds</span></span> the birth of it, which
                        is not of the substance but superfluity of the infant, and therefore to be 
                        separated: They are waters, because in fire they <span class="choice"><span class="orig">Shew </span><span class="reg">Show</span></span> a <span class="choice"><span class="orig">watry </span><span class="reg">watery</span></span> nature, that
                        is, flowing and liquidity, which agrees with water: Manifest it is that the 
                        <span class="choice"><span class="orig">propertyes </span><span class="reg">properties</span></span> of waters are different and <span class="choice"><span class="orig">wonderfull </span><span class="reg">wonderful</span></span>, whereof some <span class="choice"><span class="orig">doe </span><span class="reg">do</span></span> <span class="choice"><span class="orig">petrefy </span><span class="reg">petrify</span></span>, being coagulated into very hard stones <span class="choice"><span class="orig">fitt </span><span class="reg">fit</span></span> for building: Very like these are the 
                        Philosophers <span class="choice"><span class="orig">minerall </span><span class="reg">mineral</span></span> waters, which <span class="choice"><span class="orig">doe </span><span class="reg">do</span></span> condense, and <span class="choice"><span class="orig">turne </span><span class="reg">turn</span></span> into a stony consistence: They are <span class="choice"><span class="orig">allso </span><span class="reg">also</span></span> called Sulphurs because of the virtue of Sulphur, 
                        which they comprehend in them, for the Sulphur of nature is mixed and 
                        made one with the other Sulphur, and the two Sulphurs are dissolved by one,
                        and one is separated from two, and the Sulphurs are <span class="choice"><span class="orig">præserved </span><span class="reg">preserved</span></span> and contained
                        by Sulphurs, as Yximidius in Turba <span class="choice"><span class="orig">sayth </span><span class="reg">says</span></span>: Now what Sulphurs are Dardaris
                        there declares in these words: Sulphurs are Souls hidden in the <span class="choice"><span class="orig">fower </span><span class="reg">four</span></span> elements,
                        which being extracted by art <span class="choice"><span class="orig">doe </span><span class="reg">do</span></span> naturally <span class="choice"><span class="orig">containe </span><span class="reg">contain</span></span> one another and are

                        is hidden in the belly of Sulphur, that hidden thing meeting with its <span class="choice"><span class="orig">owne </span><span class="reg">own</span></span> 
                        nature <span class="choice"><span class="orig">rejoyceth </span><span class="reg">rejoices</span></span>, even as water with its like. I will now tell you (<span class="choice"><span class="orig">Sayth </span><span class="reg">Says</span></span> Mosius
                        <span class="choice"><span class="orig">allso </span><span class="reg">also</span></span>) what it is: the first <span class="choice"><span class="orig">indeed </span><span class="reg">in deed</span></span>, which is fiery Argent vive, the second, the 
                        body compounded in it, and the third is the water of Sulphur, by which the
                        first is <span class="choice"><span class="orig">washd </span><span class="reg">washed</span></span>, and dilacerated, and governed, till the <span class="choice"><span class="orig">worke </span><span class="reg">work</span></span> be accomplished:
                        That which is <span class="choice"><span class="orig">sayd </span><span class="reg">said</span></span> of Sulphurs, the same may be understood of <span class="choice"><span class="orig">soe </span><span class="reg">so</span></span> 
                        many <span class="choice"><span class="orig">Mercuryes </span><span class="reg">Mercuries</span></span>: For this <span class="choice"><span class="orig">sayth </span><span class="reg">says</span></span> the same Mosius afterwards: Argent vive
                        Cambar is the Magnesia, but Argent vive or Auripigment is that Sulphur
                        which ascends from a <span class="choice"><span class="orig">mixd </span><span class="reg">mixed</span></span> compound: But I will <span class="choice"><span class="orig">omitt </span><span class="reg">omit</span></span> the inference of
