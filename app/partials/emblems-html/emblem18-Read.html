                        had not been <span class="choice"><span class="orig">increasd </span><span class="reg">increased</span></span> and made stronger in it, which without doubt was 
                        done by revocation of the dispersed virtues as it were into one point or pole, 
                        or by the attraction of the same out of a great body into a <span class="choice"><span class="orig">lesse </span><span class="reg">less</span></span>: Others are
                        found, who say that a plumbifying Stone may be made by the Sulphurous
