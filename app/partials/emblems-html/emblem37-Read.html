                        proper names: The author of Aurora, chapt. 20. speaking of the Separation of the Elements, <span class="choice"><span class="orig">Sayth </span><span class="reg">Says</span></span>, Earth is left in the same place, that
                        the other three Elements may be radicated in it; if it were not for
                        that, the Elements could have <span class="choice"><span class="orig">noe </span><span class="reg">no</span></span> foundation to build upon it a new
                        <span class="choice"><span class="orig">jewell </span><span class="reg">jewel</span></span> house: This foundation is here called Aqua fœtida, which is

                        the Elixir in the <span class="choice"><span class="orig">begining </span><span class="reg">beginning</span></span>, and the end: It is called Aqua fœtida,
                        because it sends forth a Sulphureous <span class="choice"><span class="orig">stinke </span><span class="reg">stink</span></span>, and the smell of Sepulchers: 
                        This is that water, which Pegasus <span class="choice"><span class="orig">strucke </span><span class="reg">struck</span></span> out of Parnassus with his <span class="choice"><span class="orig">hoofe </span><span class="reg">hoof</span></span>,

                        reason of its most excessive strength: This is that Dragons water, as Rosarius calls it, which ought to be made by an <span class="choice"><span class="orig">Alembicke </span><span class="reg">Alembic</span></span>, without adding 
                        any other thing, in the making of which there is an extraordinary <span class="choice"><span class="orig">stinke </span><span class="reg">stink</span></span>:
                        Which words some having heard <span class="choice"><span class="orig">betooke </span><span class="reg">betook</span></span> themselves to distill the dung of

                        if there be any, is presently changed into great fragrancy, as Lully asserts
                        of his Quintessence, to which <span class="choice"><span class="orig">hee </span><span class="reg">he</span></span> ascribes such a <span class="choice"><span class="orig">sweetnesse </span><span class="reg">sweetness</span></span> of <span class="choice"><span class="orig">savour </span><span class="reg">savor</span></span>, if

                        birds flying to it, and <span class="choice"><span class="orig">causeth </span><span class="reg">causes</span></span> them to stand: But <span class="choice"><span class="orig">hee </span><span class="reg">he</span></span> puts his Quintessence
