                        because of the <span class="choice"><span class="orig">aire </span><span class="reg">air</span></span> descending thitherto, and supplying the vacuity of those

                        alone lives in fire: Now the Salamander is a creeping <span class="choice"><span class="orig">vermine </span><span class="reg">vermin</span></span>, not much

                        bred in fire, this not; but if it falls into fire it is not presently burned

                        through the flame: That is <span class="choice"><span class="orig">hott </span><span class="reg">hot</span></span> and dry this cold and moist: For every

                        and dry, as its like, and on the contrary the moist and cold caverns
                        of rocks, being full of water, <span class="choice"><span class="orig">doe </span><span class="reg">do</span></span> bring forth this cold and moist <span class="choice"><span class="orig">vermyne </span><span class="reg">vermin</span></span>.
